                <p>Kazakhstan is engulfed in the worst street protests since the country gained independence three decades ago with government buildings set ablaze and dozens of protesters killed.
                    The protests started in the southwestern oil town of Zhanaozen on 2 January over sharp increases in gas prices.
                    But they quickly spread across the country with demonstrations in Nur-Sultan and Almaty, the economic capital.
                    In a bid to quell the unrest, authorities first cut the price of gas.
                    President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev then dismissed the entire government. He also declared a state of emergency in several areas, including Almaty, where there is a nighttime curfew.</p>

                <p>U.S. hospitals are caring for the highest number of patients with Covid-19 reported during the pandemic, 
                    according to federal government data, as the Omicron variant worsens pressures on the already 
                    strained facilities.

                <p>Despite winning the Australian Open a record nine times, it is likely to be Novak Djokovic‘s quest for a 10th title which goes down in history as the most memorable.
                    The world No 1 was detained on 5 January after a nine-hour stand-off at Melbourne Airport, with the Australian government cancelling his visa in a row over whether he had a valid exemption to get round the country’s Covid-19 vaccine requirements.
                    The Serbian national then spent the following days in an immigration hotel while his legal team put forward an appeal on the basis that he had tested positive on 16 December and had natural immunity.

                <p>The NHS has said animal organ transplants for humans are “a potentially safe and attainable future treatment option” after a genetically modified pig heart was transplanted into a 57-year old handyman with good early results.
                    The health service is closely watching the outcome of the groundbreaking operation in the US as it looks at ways of cutting the queue for donor organs.
                    Surgeons in the USA have reported that a man with terminal heart disease was successfully implanted with a genetically modified pig heart for the first time, and that three days later he is doing well. David Bennett, 57, 
                    underwent the seven-hour procedure at University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore.</p>
